📌 Microsoft Fabric LMS Analytics Project
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric for analyzing Learning Management System (LMS) data. It processes student demographics, course enrollments, learning preferences, and performance metrics using Microsoft Fabric components such as OneLake, Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. Additionally, it includes CI/CD automation for seamless deployment and updates.

📊 Data Processing Flow
Raw → Landing: Ingests raw data from LMS into OneLake

Landing → Bronze: Cleans and stores structured data in the Bronze Lakehouse

Bronze → Silver: Applies data transformations for analytics-ready data

Silver → Gold: Aggregates final data with business logic in Gold Lakehouse

End-to-End Orchestration: Automates scheduling using Data Factory Pipelines
